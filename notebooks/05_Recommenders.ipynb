    "Recommender algorithms are widely used in commerce. Further, the basic algorithms have found applications in other areas. In this Assignment you gain some experience working with recommender data, the collaborative filtering algorithm and some versions of the nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm.           \n",

    "This Assignment uses the Python [Surprise](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) package a Scikit for recommender system experimentation. This package is in maintenance mode, but is still useful for learning recommender concepts. If you have not previously installed Surprise you will need to install it. Generally, the best way to install this older package is to run the command below from a command prompt on your system. If you have difficulty, you can refer to [this Stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62042317/cannot-install-scikit-surprise-on-my-jupyter-notebook).      "
