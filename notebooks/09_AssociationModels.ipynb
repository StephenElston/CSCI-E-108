A basket is a set of items assocaited with a single event such as a purchase by a customer at the store. The goal is to find rules for **frequent item sets** that associate common items found with high probability in the baskets.  \n",

    "THe final question to address how can one understand and apply these association rules. To do so, it is necessary to consider multiple evaluation metrics. As you have seen, association rules are minned using support as the metric. However, when faced with large sets of association rules it is necssary to filter the set to the most effective or important rules. Any of the evaluation metrics can be used as filtering criteria, including:    \n",
