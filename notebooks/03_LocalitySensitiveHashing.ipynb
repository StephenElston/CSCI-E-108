    "In these exercises you will work with mini-hashes and locally-sensitive hashes on a small test dataset. The dataset comprises 4 articles from CNN.com. The 5th item in the dataset is a test document that is a concatenation of sections of 3 of the CNN articles, first, second and fourth. This 5th article is expected to produce artificially high similarity scores. With this small dataset you can easily compare approximations from the hashing methods to the fully Jaccard similarity scores between the text files.  \n",

    "Key steps in this example are: \n",
    "1. Clean and split each text file into a set of K-shingles, using a shingling function.     \n",
    "2. Compute the Jaccard similarity (intersection over union) between all pairs using the full set of shingles, no approximation.   \n",
    "3. Create and apply a MinHashing class which does the following:\n",
    "    - Initialize a dictionary of key-value pairs for the shingles.\n",
    "    - Apply minhashing on a shingle set with \"universal hashing\".\n",
    "    - Create a function to compute a **signature matrix**.\n",
    "4. Evaluate the effectiveness of mini-hashing by computing Jaccard similarity scores of all document pairs.\n",
    "5. Use locally sensitive hashing (LSH) to find **candidate pairs** of high similarity documents. Specifically, use a banded signature matrix to find all pairs whose estimated similarity is above a threshold. A hash table for band and column column ids to enable fast, $O(n)$, comparisons.\n",
