    "# Assignment 01 - Pitfalls in Data Mining     \n",
    "## CSCI E-96\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of data mining is to find important relationships in large complex datasets. These dataset typically contain a large number of variables. The **high-dimensional** nature of the data leads to some commonly encountered pitfalls which lead to incorrect inferences.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will gain a bit of experience with three important concepts in data mining at a small scale. These methods are essential as the scale increases:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **False Discovery Rate Control:** The goal of data mining is to find important relationships in large complex datasets. These dataset typically contain a large number of variables. The **high-dimensional** nature of the data leads to some commonly encountered pitfalls of incorrect inference, **false discovery**. A related problem is cutting off a large-scale analysis when a desired relationship is 'found'. This practice of **p-value mining** often leads to unwarranted inferences. You will apply false discovery rate (FDR) control methods to address this problem.   \n",
    "2. **Key-Value Pairs:** Large scale data is typically managed using key-value (KV) pairs. The exercises in this assignment give you some experience working with KV pair data management.  \n",
    "3. **Map and Reduce Processes:** Much of large scale data mining requires use of a split-apply-combine approach. The data is split into manageable chunks, analytic transformations are applied, and the result combined or aggregated. A commonly used class of a split-apply-combine algorithm is MapReduce. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to keep the scope of this assignment manageable, you will use limited versions of KV pair management and MapReduce. Specifically, you will use common Python tools to implement these concepts rather than dedicated large scale analytic platforms. "

Examine the code below and notice that the hash function encodes the two indexes into a single integer by simple additional and multiplication. The modulo operation limits the size of the hash table. However, to keep things simple you will not implement any hash collision resolution mechanism. As a result, the size of the table is set much larger than required.  \n",

To do so you must find all **combinations** of keys, $\\{i,j\\}$. The MapReduce processes you will create, are intended to create a table of these unique pairwise key combinations. The t-test is then computed from the values in the `normal_vars` table in the Reduce process. This MapReduce process only creates the required key combinations. The values remain in the `normal_vars` table. This approach simplifies some of the bookkeeping.     \n",

    "- The **Map process** builds a hash table with the hash of i,j as key and i,j as values. As has been noted most of this hash table will contain NaNs. The hash table is still relatively small, since the values of the vectors used for the statistical calculations are not stored in the table, only the results. Please don't be confused by the switching roles of i,j as they act as keys and values at different times.   \n",
    "- The **Shuffle** scans the hash table for non-empty rows (not NaN values for i,j) and builds a table of unique combination of keys i and j.   \n",

The resulting table contains the i,j pairs as the keys for the random variable lookup. The t-test is applied to these numeric values. The results are sorted and returned.   \n",

The data frame will be indexed by the key value computed by hashing the $[i,j]$ pairs, which gives nearly $O(n)$ performance for lookups. This implementation is only for demonstration purposes only and has several significant limitations compared to a production quality implementation. \n",
    "> 1. You will use a fixed length datafrsme. We take advantage of the fact the index lookup in Pandas data frames uses a hash table. In other words, referencing a row (or column) of a Pandas data frame is a key-value lookup using a hash table. \n",
    "> 2. You will not need to implement a collision resolution mechanism so a larger table is required, which is not particularly memory efficient. At scale, a sparse representation of the table would be used.     \n",
